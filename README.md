# I - State of the art :

The Distributed and Flexible Job shop Scheduling Problem consists of a set of : 
- factories( F = 1, 2,..., l) 
- set of jobs( N = 1, 2,..., i)
- geographically distributed with a travel time( Dli).
- Each factory has a set of machines.
- Each job i consists of a sequence of Nj operations Oi j, i = ,2,. N; j = ,2,., Nj
- Each operation can be reused on different machine with different processing times(Pijrf). 

The idea of the DFJSP is to associate or allocate to each factory a job while respecting the hypotheses and constraints and also determine the product scheduling
in each plant in order to minimize the maximum completion time( makespan) among all factories. 

In DFJSP, we consider the following hypotheses and constraints :

- 1 - It's generally assumed that each machine can only handle one operation at each time.
- 2 - Each operation can only be reused after its priority operation.
- 3 - Each operation has to be carried out on only one machine.
- 4 - Once a job is allocated to a plant, all of its operations will be reused in that plant.
- 5 - The operations have to be progressed until completion.
